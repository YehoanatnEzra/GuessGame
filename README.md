# GuessGame
This is a simple Bash-based number guessing game I created as part of my self learning journey with Bash scripting.
The player chooses a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard), then tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts and time.
The game includes colorful output, optional hints, and a high score tracking system saved per difficulty level.  

have fun :)
